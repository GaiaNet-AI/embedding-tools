Before turning on your device, charge the phone fully. To install the SIM, place the SIM card into the tray with the gold contacts facing up.


### Maintaining water and dust resistance

> NOTE: Your device is IP68 rated for dust and water resistance. To maintain the water-resistant and dust-resistant features of your device, make sure that the SIM card tray openings are maintained free of dust and water, and the tray is securely inserted prior to any exposure to liquids.

The device is not impervious to dust and water damage in any situation. It is important that all compartments are closed tightly. You can Learn more at [Mobile Terms and Conditions](samsung.com).

Follow these tips carefully to prevent damage to the device and maintain dust and water resistance performance:

> CAUTION: To avoid electric shock and damage to your device, do not charge device while it is wet or in an area where it could get wet. Do not handle device, charger or cords with wet hands while charging.

- Water resistant based on IP68 rating, which tests submersion in fresh water deeper than 1.5 meters or keep it submerged for more than 30 minutes. If your device is exposed to fresh water, shake it to remove any excess water and dry the device thoroughly with a clean, soft cloth.
- If your device is exposed to liquids other than fresh water (such as saltwater), rinse your device with fresh water and dry it with a clean, soft cloth and shake it to remove any excess water.
- Any device which uses accessible compartments or ports that can be opened should have these sealed or closed tightly to prevent liquid from entering the system.
- If the device has been immersed in water or the microphone or speaker is wet, sound may not be heard clearly during a call while the device is immersed or the microphone or speaker is wet.
- Do not expose the device to water at high pressure.
- If the device is dropped or receives an impact that causes physical damage to the device, the water and dust resistant features of the device may be affected. If you suspect your device has been damaged because of a fall or impact, take it to a Samsung-authorized service center for inspection.

### Charge the battery
